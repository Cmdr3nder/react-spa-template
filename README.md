# React Project Template

### Prerequisites
Node ^16.9.1
Npm ^7.24.0
Make
Entr

### Preparing to dev
With `make` (preferred):
1. Install `node` and `npm`
1. Install npm dependencies with `make install`
1. Run a one-off build with `make build`
1. Run a dev-server serving that build with `make serve`
1. Run a watching build with `make watch-build`, this will rebuild under most file changes
	* In order to stop `make watch-build` you will need to double-tap CTRL-C twice in relatively rapid succession.
1. Suggestion: Run `make serve` and `make watch-build` simultaneously to achieve a tight development loop

Without `make`:
ARE WE MAKING THIS POSSIBLE? TBD
